# eth_game

In this repository you can see my version of the game coded as part of the course "Ethereum Game Programming" at Moralis Academy.
For the game animation Phaser 3.15.1 was used.
The boosts you aquire in the game are ERC1155 Tokens and change the behaviour of the game, like increassing speed, increasing coin generation and slowing the timer.
